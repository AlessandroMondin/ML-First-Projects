These were my university projects at MIP Politecnico di Milano:
1) The Regression_Supervised_Learning.ipynb one concerned the creation of a model that had to foresee the transcoding time of an audio given a set of parameters.
2) The Supervised_Learning_cross_selling.ipynb one regarded identifying custumers the were more likely to buy more products of the company in the future (upselling).
