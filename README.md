### Hello! <br>
This is a pipeline that I created to train models to identify the customers who were likely to go bankrupt in 1/2/3 year w.r.t. t0.<br>The training dataset very imbalanced and I dealt with it via both feature-engineering, and by training the models to maximize the recall on the validation set.
