### A machine learing pipeline <br>
This is a pipeline that I created for an internal competition. The task was to identify the customers who were likely to go bankrupt in 1/2/3 year w.r.t. t0.<br>The training dataset was very imbalanced and I dealt with it via both feature-engineering, and by enforcing the models to maximize the recall on the validation set.
